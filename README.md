# Robert_Kaliga_Web_Wroclaw

The project showcases the implementation of a shopping cart on a website. To create this project, I used React + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The functionality of the project is based on a Redux store, which allows for globally storing, removing, and modifying the quantity of products in the cart. As this is a demo project, I focused on simplicity and ensuring that all functionalities were fulfilled.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended, includes npm)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, set up the necessary dependencies, and run the frontend and backend applications.

1.  _Clone the Repository_

    Open your terminal or command prompt, clone the project repository, and navigate into the newly created project directory:

    git clone [https://github.com/Berc1k/Robert_Kaliga_Web_Wroclaw.git]
    cd shop

    _All subsequent commands should be run from within this shop directory unless otherwise specified._

2.  \_Set up and Run

    The frontend application is located in the shop directory. It's recommended to open a _dedicated terminal window_ for this process.

    Navigate into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the development server:

    # Make sure you are in the 'shop' root directory

    cd shop
    npm install
    npm run dev

    This command will typically start the frontend development server. Check the terminal output for the exact URL (often http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, or similar).
